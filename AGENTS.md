# events-helper — agent/contributor guide

This project uses the **eve framework** (durable, filesystem-first agents). Before
writing code, read the relevant guide from the installed eve package docs. In most
installs they are at `node_modules/eve/docs/`. In workspaces or local package
installs, resolve the installed `eve` package location first and read its `docs/`
directory. If package docs are unavailable, use https://eve.dev/docs as a fallback.

## What this agent does

Helps a team track tech-conference **Call for Papers (CfPs)** and events, matched to
each user's interests, filed into **Jira**, and summarized into **Slack** on a
schedule. Data comes from the [developers.events](https://developers.events) feeds
plus any feeds the agent discovers by web search.

## Key decisions (why it's built this way)

- **Model is env-configurable** via `EVE_MODEL` (Vercel AI Gateway id). Resolved once at
  module load; change env + redeploy to switch. No per-conversation model swap in eve.
- **Persistence = private Vercel Blob** (`BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN`), one JSON blob per key,
  keys are pathnames. Falls back to a local JSON file when the token is absent so `eve dev`
  works offline. Chosen over Edge Config (eventually-consistent writes) and Upstash.
- **Interests are two-layer and per-user.** GLOBAL (admin-managed, drives the digest) +
  PERSONAL overlay (add + exclude). `effective = (global ∪ personal.add) − personal.exclude`.
  Caller identity comes from `ctx.session.auth.current` (never model input). Admins gated by
  `EVENTS_HELPER_ADMIN_IDS` (open until set). **Sources are a shared team catalog.**
- **Token-usage awareness** (`lib/usage.ts` + `hooks/usage.ts` + `instructions/usage.ts`).
  Per-session ceilings set on `defineAgent({ limits })` (env-tunable) fail the next call with
  `SESSION_TOKEN_LIMIT_REACHED`. The hook accumulates `step.completed` usage into durable session
  state, logs running totals (trace-correlated), alerts the ops channel once at `EVE_TOKEN_WARN_PCT`
  and on token-limit/rate-limit `turn.failed`, and counts compactions. Dynamic instructions inject a
  budget line each turn so the agent proactively warns the user. Model usage per turn is also on the
  Bronto spans + Vercel Agent Runs (`$eve.*` tags) — this adds session-cumulative awareness + limits.
- **Per-user alerts are opt-in** (`lib/alerts.ts`). A daily schedule DMs each **subscribed**
  user (ledger `events-helper/alerts/user/<principalId>.json`, subscription flag lives there, not in
  the interest profile) the CfPs matching their effective interests that are newly matched or
  closing-soon, **plus newly-announced events** matching their interests (e.g. from watched Meetup
  groups), as interactive Block Kit cards. Buttons (`cfp_dismiss`/`cfp_snooze`/`event_dismiss`/
  `event_snooze`) are handled by the Slack channel's `onInteraction` (side-effects only — a button
  can't start a turn); "file to Jira" is a DM reply. One subscription covers both CfPs and events.
  **Event alerts are baselined on first run** (`eventBaselineAt`): the first pass records the current
  matches and sends nothing, so a user only ever gets events announced *after* they subscribed, never
  a backlog flood (events are far higher-volume than CfPs). The ledger is normalized on read
  (`{...EMPTY_LEDGER, ...stored}`) so older CfP-only ledgers back-fill the event fields safely.
  Subscribers enumerated via `store.listKeys`. Cards are raw Block Kit (`lib/cards.ts`), not the JSX
  card DSL, so we control button `action_id`/`value`. Toggle events off independently with
  `EVENTS_HELPER_EVENT_ALERTS_ENABLED=false`.
- **Meetup + Luma = generic iCal, not bespoke integrations** (`lib/ical.ts`). We deliberately did
  **not** build platform API clients. Meetup's official API is Pro-only/own-groups and its ToS forbids
  bulk aggregation + HTML scraping — but every **public** group publishes an official iCalendar feed at
  `meetup.com/<group>/events/ical/`, and every **Luma calendar** exposes one at
  `api.lu.ma/ics/get?entity=calendar&id=<cal-id>` — exactly what a calendar app subscribes to. So we
  built a **generic iCal source kind** (`kind: "ical"` on `Source`): any `.ics` URL becomes an events
  source, fetched + parsed (RFC 5545: line-unfolding, params, `DTSTART` date parse at day
  granularity) + normalized to `EventItem`, cached per-feed in Blob with a TTL (`ICAL_CACHE_TTL_MIN`)
  so we poll politely. `manage_sources` calls `resolveIcalUrl` to turn a **Meetup group URL /
  `meetup:<slug>`** or a **Luma calendar URL / `luma:<cal-id>`** into the underlying feed (Luma page
  URLs are fetched to discover the calendar's `api_id`), and validates on add (private/empty calendars
  are rejected). A generic parser rule handles Luma putting the event URL in `LOCATION`: if `LOCATION`
  is a URL and there's no `URL`, it becomes the event link (location falls back to the source's label).
  Because the watchlist is now large (~230 feeds), the iCal fan-out in `queryEvents` runs in bounded
  batches (`ICAL_FETCH_CONCURRENCY`, default 8) rather than all at once, to avoid rate-limiting a host.
  Watched events flow through `queryEvents`, the digest, the source scan (team-wide "what's new" to the
  ops channel), and per-user event alerts. Note re Luma: its **discover pages surface globally-featured
  calendars, not per-city ones**, so Luma is added as hand-picked calendars, not bulk-harvested. This
  **reverses** the earlier "skip Meetup" decision, which was about *bulk aggregating all of Meetup* — a
  curated watchlist of public iCal feeds is a different, legitimate use. Gate with `ICAL_ENABLED=false`.
- **Roles** (`lib/roles.ts`): **admins** (`EVENTS_HELPER_ADMIN_IDS`) may edit global settings;
  **super admins / operators** (`EVENTS_HELPER_SUPER_ADMIN_IDS`) are a superset with extra
  privileges. Open until either list is configured, then enforced. Identity comes from
  `ctx.session.auth.current`, never the model.
- **Jira = Atlassian remote MCP** via Vercel Connect, **user-scoped** (each user signs in with
  their own Atlassian account). Writes gated on approval by a name-based policy.
- **Slack + Jira run through Vercel Connect** — no bot tokens/signing secrets in code.
- **Observability datasets** (Bronto collection `events-helper`): traces **and** runtime logs share
  `agent-runtime` (`BRONTO_DATASET`); deployment events go to `agent-deployments`
  (`BRONTO_DEPLOY_DATASET`). Keep this split — don't send logs to the deploy dataset or vice versa.
- **Deployment provenance for correlation** (`lib/deploy.ts`). Traces (OTel resource attributes) and
  every app log are stamped with OTel-semconv `vcs.ref.head.revision` (commit), `deployment.id`,
  `vcs.ref.head.name`, `deployment.environment.name`. The commit is injected by `scripts/deploy.sh`
  via `vercel deploy -e EVENTS_HELPER_COMMIT=<sha>` (matches the deploy log exactly); deployment id /
  env come from Vercel runtime env. The deploy log (`notify-deploy.mjs`) uses the same semconv keys,
  so you can filter `vcs.ref.head.revision=<sha>` (or `deployment.id`) across traces, logs, and the
  deployment event.
- **Traces export immediately** (`instrumentation.ts` uses a `SimpleSpanProcessor`, not the default
  batch). In the serverless/Workflow runtime a batch could go unflushed before the instance
  suspended, dropping spans — which left some logs (pushed immediately) referencing a `traceId` whose
  trace never reached Bronto. Immediate per-span export matches the log push and fixes that.
- **Observability**: OTLP traces → Bronto (`instrumentation.ts`); structured app logs via `lib/log.ts`
  carry the active `traceId`/`spanId` so they correlate with those spans. Use `log.info/warn/error`
  in tools/lib for meaningful events (never log secrets). `lib/log.ts` also **pushes logs directly to
  Bronto `/v1/logs`** (fire-and-forget) when Bronto env is set, so logs reach Bronto on a **free Vercel
  plan** without a drain — set `BRONTO_DIRECT_LOGS=false` once a Vercel log **Drain** (Pro+; see README)
  is live, to avoid duplicates. The deploy script also emits a deployment log to Bronto.

## Keep the docs in sync (required)

Whenever you change behavior, setup, configuration, or the file layout, update the affected docs
**in the same change** — this is a standing requirement, not a nice-to-have:

| Doc | Keep current when you change… |
| --- | --- |
| `AGENTS.md` | file map, decisions, conventions, env vars, deploy flow |
| `README.md` | install/deploy steps, env vars, integration setup, scripts |
| `docs/USER-GUIDE.md` | anything an end user says to the bot, or user-visible behavior |
| `SUMMARY.md` | append what changed and why (it's the running build log / blog source) |

The pre-commit hook prints a reminder when `agent/` changes without a doc change. Treat env-var
changes as doc changes: update the tables in both `AGENTS.md` and `README.md`.

## Telemetry conventions (required)

All telemetry — **logs, metrics, and traces** — MUST follow OpenTelemetry semantic conventions.

- **Before adding any attribute, check the OTel semconv registry**
  (<https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/>). If a suitable attribute exists, use its exact
  key: e.g. `error.type`, `user.id`, `user.roles`, `url.full`, `service.name`, `deployment.id`,
  `deployment.environment.name`, `vcs.ref.head.revision`, `gen_ai.usage.input_tokens`,
  `gen_ai.usage.output_tokens`.
- **Do not invent keys that duplicate/collide with semconv**, and **do not use deprecated ones**
  (e.g. `error.message` is deprecated → use `error.type` for a low-cardinality class + put variable
  text in the log body or `events_helper.error.detail`).
- **No semconv equivalent? Namespace it under `events_helper.*`** (snake_case segments), e.g.
  `events_helper.query.matched`. Never place custom data under reserved/semconv namespaces.
- **Framework attributes keep eve's keys** (e.g. `eve.session.id`) so logs correlate with eve's
  spans.
- Applies to `agent/lib/log.ts` call sites, `agent/lib/deploy.ts`, `agent/instrumentation.ts`, and
  `scripts/notify-deploy.mjs`. When adding a log/attribute, confirm the key against semconv first.

## Conventions

- **NodeNext modules**: relative imports use `.js` extensions (e.g. `../lib/feeds.js`).
- **Tools**: `defineTool` + Zod `inputSchema`; never trust the model for identity/tenancy — read
  it from `ctx.session.auth`. Gate state-changing external actions with approval.
- **Secrets** come from env vars only; never hard-code. Local secrets live in `.env.local`
  (gitignored). The local Blob fallback file `.events-helper-store.json` is gitignored.
- **Verify** with `npm run typecheck`, then `npm exec -- eve dev --no-ui` and exercise the HTTP
  API (`POST /eve/v1/session`, `GET /eve/v1/session/:id/stream`). Model calls need an AI Gateway
  credential (`AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY` or `eve link`).

## Deploy

Standing instruction from the owner: **redeploy to production automatically after changes that
should go live** (no per-deploy confirmation needed).

Deploy through the wrapper so the operator is notified with a change summary:

```bash
npm run deploy   # scripts/deploy.sh: summary → deploy → Slack DM to the operator
```

It diffs `git` from the last recorded deploy (`.last-deploy-sha`, gitignored), deploys, then posts
the summary to `EVENTS_HELPER_DEPLOY_NOTIFY_CHANNEL` via `scripts/notify-deploy.mjs`. That helper
uses the `@vercel/connect` **SDK** with the OIDC token from env (the CLI cannot mint the app-subject
Slack token — only the runtime/OIDC can). Notification is **best-effort**: if `VERCEL_OIDC_TOKEN` is
missing/expired (refresh with `vercel env pull`), the deploy still succeeds and the notice is
skipped. The raw `VERCEL_USE_EXPERIMENTAL_FRAMEWORKS=1 vercel deploy --prod` also works but never
notifies.

Vercel project: `brontoio/events-helper` (team `brontoio`, project `prj_UVBCFToFKHcBiVVGdGrCF9V21jto`),
on a Pro plan. SSO deployment protection is **disabled** (required so Slack/Connect webhooks reach the
app; app-layer auth still guards routes). Both Connect connectors live under this team with the default
UIDs (`slack/bronto-events-helper`, `mcp.atlassian.com/atlassian`), and the Slack trigger is re-pointed
to `/eve/v1/slack`. The managed Slack app is `@brontoeventshelper` — invite it to the digest and ops
channels after any fresh Connect (re)install. See `README.md` for the full env-var list and one-time
Connect setup.
